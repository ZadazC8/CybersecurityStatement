Hi, my name is Harold, I'm a passoniate about technology and cybersecurity. In all fields of my life the main characteristic is my curiosity, in the field of cybersecurity my curiosity explodes and 
I always try to find various ways to keep sensitive information safe and also safeguard digital landscapes from threats.
I am constantly changing and evolving, especially in my professional life, learning new skills to develop my passions.

Strengths
Good communication, time management and problem solving. Working as a team on each of these things is really important to keep the harmony and good environment. 
If the team does not develop it, it will be a weakness. Also, I want to improve my programming skills and technical skills in this field. 

Values
Protect people: Every person has sensitive information, no matter if they are an “important” person or a “normal” person. Keeping PII and SPII secure is important work.
Comply with the laws: By following the laws and protocols previously designed can prevent damage. I am dedicated to following the parameters and acting with ethical commitment.

I want to dedicate myself to this field, because I know the value of information and without control, it can cause a lot of damage to companies, people and even the environment. 
Someone who can manage it is like a superhero. Cybersecurity is a dangerous field but at the same time an exciting and interesting passion.

I would like to be recognized in this field for being one of the best cybersecurity analysts in Colombia and why not? one of the best in the world.
Because I want to continue improving security systems, security networks, I want to dedicate myself to building a better system for everyone and keeping threats away.
